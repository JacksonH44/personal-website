## Using this Template
To use this template, you'll need to setup your own email to receive messages from interested viewers of your portfolio.
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project by copying the template:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
and filling the required environment variables. You might need an app-specific password if your email has 2FA.
